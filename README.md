#### Coventry University – Data Analysis (Power BI)
This Power BI dashboard visualizes and analyzes key datasets related to Coventry University, providing interactive insights into trends, patterns, and KPIs.
It features:
- Dynamic filtering for targeted data exploration.

#### Key Insights
- Highlights performance metrics and trends relevant to the university’s data.
- Interactive visuals enable granular exploration for different dimensions (e.g., time periods, categories, demographics).

#### Next Time, I’d Improve By:
- Enhancing Data Model Documentation – Add a “Data Dictionary” tab in Power BI or README so users understand data sources, relationships, and calculated measures.
- Optimizing Performance – Reduce unnecessary columns and pre-aggregate data to improve load time.
- Consistent Visual Design – Apply a clear design system (color palette, typography) for accessibility and readability.
- Version Control for Measures – Keep DAX measures in a separate documented file in the repo for easier review and maintenance.
- Adding Context to Insights – Include narrative text boxes in the dashboard explaining why trends matter, not just what they are.
